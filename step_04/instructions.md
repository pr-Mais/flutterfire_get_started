# Step 4: Read and Display List of Polls

## 💡 Explanation
There is a collection of polls already stored in our Firestore database.
We want to show the list of available polls to all users.

### On this step:
1. List the polls from Firestore.
2. Listen to user click events on poll answers to a voting callback in each individual poll.
