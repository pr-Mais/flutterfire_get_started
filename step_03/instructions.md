# Step 3: Dynamically Update UI on Authentication Changes

## 💡 Explanation
The user has 2 states in out app: signed-in, or not signed-in.
In the not signed-in case, we want to show the `WelcomePage`.
In the signed-in case, we want to show the `PollsPage`.

### On this step:
1. We will decide whether user is signed-in or not, and based on that we show the desired home page.
2. Sign-in new user and show their name on the Polls Page.
