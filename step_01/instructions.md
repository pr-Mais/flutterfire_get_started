# Connect our Flutter app to Firebase

FlutterFire is a collection of plugins used to integrate Firebase in Flutter.
Firebase offers many products to build scalable apps on multiple platforms.

Some products Firebase offers:
1. Authentication with multiple providers such as Email and Password, Phone, and social providers such as Google and Apple.
2. Firestore database: a NoSQL real-time database.
3. Cloud Functions: write functions and deploy them easily to the cloud.

In this workshop, we will learn how to use Firebase in Flutter.
We will build a polls game that helps us create polls and answer them in real-time.

In the first step, we will get create a new Firebase project, then configure it in our Flutter app.

If you run the app at this step, you will see a welcome page with a field that ask you for your name.
